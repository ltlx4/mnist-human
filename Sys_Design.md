# Business process model
* The Client asked our team to create a program able to be accessed on the internet.
* We will do the software with the developers for several weeks, with documentation, concluding the necessary contracts, and in the meantime we will continuously communicate with the customer periodically.
* If the software suits both the client and the developers, we will  initially start by getting a beta version then eventually publish it.
