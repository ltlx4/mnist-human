MNIST by humans is a class project forked by Tawfiq ,Ryan and Sayin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The platform we have developed gives the user an opportunity to test there visual skills by trying to classify a given image from a mnist database.
For those who might not know what this database is, the MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. 

In our project, instead of testing it against processing systems, we will be testing it with humans to see how accurate they can e able to classify the images.
